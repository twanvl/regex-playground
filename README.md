# Regular language playground

(in development)

This will be a comprehensive tool for working with regular languages, regular expressions and finite automata.

The aims are:
 * to offer exercises to students,
 * to offer a playground for converting between various representations
 * to be a tool for checking student homework in formal languages courses.
